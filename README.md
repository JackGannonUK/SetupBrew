## About
This repository operates as a backup procedure for my brew configuration. However, it may provide some discernment into how I work - what I do and furthermore.

If you are assembling a new system and need the groundwork for your projects to be quickly implemented - this may be your repo; as time advances, more packages are added to the `Brewfile`.

## Caution
Although having an automated system to set up necessary brew packages sounds dandy, I do not know your system - and some brew packages may be problematic for your circumstances; maybe even considered bloat for some.

The packages included in the `Brewfile` are customised to my workflow. I have an Intel Hackintosh (functions identical to a Mac) - so an M1 Mac may not be able to operate some of these packages (as of writing). So I vehemently recommend you to customise the contained `Brewfile` to your preference.

## Prerequisites

 - Xcode CLI Tools `xcode-select install`
 - A Bash/Zsh terminal
